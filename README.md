## Background
Radio-frequency holography measures the electric field with a moving probe, and maps the propagation of the field through space using the measured phase information.  This repository is an open-source guide to building a holographic imaging seutp for millimeter-wave experiments.

## Project Status

This work was completed at the University of Chicago in 2021.  The setup exists at the University of Chicago KICP Department of Physics and has been used to study the optical performance of ground-based cosmology instruments. 

### Github repository

This Github repository hosts open-source holography hardware design and software insructions.

### Schematics

A schematic of the holography hardware is [here](hardware/photos/rf_holog.png).
