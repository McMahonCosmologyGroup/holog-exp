# Equipment Cables

## Power Cabling

### ROACH2 FPGA

The ROACH2 uses [ATX form-factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX#Power_supply) power supplies and cables.

### Syntonic Synthesizers

Synthesizers are powered by 

## Serial Connections

### ROACH2 FPGA

A standard [ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pair) cable connects a computer system to the ROACH's serial port. 

### Syntonic Synthesizers

Both synthesizers are programmed by the computer via a USB, which acts as a serial port. One could use a serial connection other than USB as long as it acts as a serial port when communicating with the computer.
