## Syntonic Synthesizers ##
Two synthesizers from [Mercury](https://www.mrcy.com/) are used in holography. The exact model used is the [DS-3000 MICROWAVE SYNTHESIZER](https://www.mrcy.com/products/rf-and-mixed-signal/signal-sources/ds-3000-microwave-synthesizer).

The synthesizers are controlled with USB.

## Signal Source ##
A source from [Virginia Diodes](https://www.vadiodes.com/en/products/custom-transmitters) actively multiplies the signal to the desired frequency range. 

## Harmonic Mixers and Diplexers ##
Two [harmonic mixers](http://pacificmillimeter.com/HarmonicMixers.html) detect the signal (either modulated or non-modulated by the device being tested).  The exact model depends on the frequency of the signal in the experiment.
